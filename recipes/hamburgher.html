  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>TThis is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
       <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
       <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
         <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
              Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese
               onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the 
             patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
         <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done.
              An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
